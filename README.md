# VibeCAD

VibeCAD is an AI-native parametric CAD platform for designing real 3D parts through conversation, focused modeling tools, and editable geometry history.

## Before You Start

You need a **ChatGPT subscription**, a **Grok / X (xAI) login**, or an **API key** for the provider you select. VibeCAD runs ChatGPT-subscription, Grok OAuth, and OpenAI-API-key requests through its bundled Codex runtime, connects directly to Anthropic, and can still route Codex through OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as an xAI API key, Ollama, and other local model servers.

Store the key in one of these places:

- **OS keyring (recommended):** paste the key in VibeCAD Preferences, click **Save Key**, and then click **Validate**.
- **A selected `.env` file:** create the file yourself, select it in VibeCAD Preferences, and click **Validate**. VibeCAD does not search for `.env` files automatically.

API keys are not stored in ordinary application preferences. ChatGPT OAuth credentials are owned and refreshed by the bundled Codex app-server; VibeCAD does not read or copy those tokens. Grok / X OAuth tokens are stored in a private VibeCAD Grok credential directory and refreshed by VibeCAD; they are never written to ordinary `user.cfg`.

## Install

Download the latest build from [VibeCAD Releases](https://github.com/10-X-eng/vibecad/releases/latest).

### Linux AppImage

```bash
chmod +x VibeCAD*.AppImage
./VibeCAD*.AppImage
```

### Debian Package

Run this command from the directory containing the downloaded package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./vibecad_*_amd64.deb
```

The leading `./` is required when installing a local package with `apt`.

### Windows

Download the Windows installer, run it, and launch VibeCAD from the Start menu.

SHA256 files are published beside release artifacts so downloads can be verified before installation.

## Configure an AI Provider

Open **Preferences**, then select **VibeCAD > VibeCAD**.

1. Enable **Use online provider**.
2. Select **ChatGPT subscription**, **Grok (X / xAI)**, **OpenAI API key (Codex)**, or **Anthropic** under **Provider**.
3. For ChatGPT or Grok, use the account sign-in controls described below. For an API provider, configure its key and leave the base URL blank unless you use a compatible or local endpoint.
4. Configure the selected provider's authentication.
5. Click **Fetch models**, then select a returned model.
6. Choose a supported **Reasoning effort**. Use `none` when a model does not support thinking or reasoning parameters.
7. Click **Apply** or **OK** to save the provider, model, endpoint, and `.env` path settings.

### Sign In With a ChatGPT Subscription

1. Select **ChatGPT subscription** as the provider.
2. Click **Sign in with ChatGPT** and complete the browser flow. Use **Use device code** when the browser callback cannot reach VibeCAD.
3. Click **Fetch models** and select a subscription model, or leave **Use account default** selected.
4. Choose a reasoning effort offered by that model, then click **Apply** or **OK**.

ChatGPT credentials are stored in a private VibeCAD Codex credential directory and refreshed by the bundled, version-pinned app-server. **Logout** asks that runtime to remove the account. VibeCAD never imports credentials from another Codex installation and never falls back to an ambient API key.

### Sign In With Grok / X

1. Select **Grok (X / xAI)** as the provider.
2. Click **Sign in with X / Grok** and complete the xAI browser flow at `accounts.x.ai`. Use **Use device code** when the local callback cannot reach VibeCAD (SSH, containers, or a blocked loopback port).
3. Click **Fetch models** and select a Grok model, or keep the default `grok-4.6`.
4. Choose a reasoning effort offered by that model, then click **Apply** or **OK**.

This is real xAI OAuth against the documented issuer `https://auth.x.ai` (authorization, device-code, and token endpoints from xAI's OpenID configuration). VibeCAD reuses the official public Grok CLI OAuth client shipped by xAI in [xai-org/grok-build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build); xAI does not publish a separate VibeCAD app registration. You need an active SuperGrok subscription or an X Premium+ account that xAI has linked to your xAI session.

Grok OAuth tokens are stored only under the private VibeCAD Grok credential directory and are refreshed automatically. **Logout** revokes and deletes that store. Inference uses the xAI Responses-compatible API at `https://api.x.ai/v1` through the bundled Codex runtime.

If OAuth login succeeds but model calls return HTTP 403, xAI may be gating the OAuth API surface by subscription tier. Use the API-key fallback below in that case.

ChatGPT subscription, Grok OAuth, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, and offline/debug turns all
use the same frozen authoring-surface resolver. The human chooses either
**VibeScript** or **Native** in the Assistant header. VibeScript exposes the
active workbench's exact source-backed API. Native exposes only the complete
tool families belonging to the human-selected VibeCAD ribbon. A provider can
never select or switch a workbench, ribbon, or authoring mode for itself.

### Save a Key in the OS Keyring

1. Select the provider first. Keys are stored separately for OpenAI and Anthropic.
2. Paste the provider key into **API key**.
3. Click **Save Key**. The field clears after VibeCAD hands the key to the operating system's credential store.
4. Click **Validate**. A successful check reports `verified` in **Auth status**.
5. Click **Fetch models** and choose the model to use.

**Logout** removes only the selected provider's keyring entry. It does not remove a process environment variable or edit a selected `.env` file.

### Use a `.env` File

Create a text file containing the variable for the selected provider:

```dotenv
# OpenAI and OpenAI-compatible providers, including xAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

In VibeCAD Preferences:

1. Click **Browse** beside **.env path** and select that exact file.
2. Leave the **API key** field empty; **Save Key** is only for the OS keyring.
3. Click **Validate**, then **Fetch models**.
4. Click **Apply** or **OK** so the selected path is used by future sessions.

Do not commit a `.env` file containing a real key to source control.

### Credential Precedence

VibeCAD resolves a key in this order:

1. The provider's process environment variable.
2. The `.env` file explicitly selected in Preferences.
3. The OS keyring.

This order matters when a valid key appears to be ignored. For example, an old `OPENAI_API_KEY` exported by the shell overrides both the selected `.env` file and a newer key saved in the keyring.

## Configure Grok With an xAI API Key (Fallback)

Prefer **Sign in with X / Grok** when you have SuperGrok or X Premium+. The API-key path remains available when OAuth is gated or you already have a console key:

1. Obtain an API key from xAI.
2. Select **OpenAI API key (Codex)** as the provider.
3. Set **OpenAI base URL** to `https://api.x.ai/v1`.
4. Paste the xAI key, click **Save Key**, and then click **Validate**.
5. Click **Fetch models** and select the Grok model returned by xAI.
6. Choose a reasoning effort supported by that model, then click **Apply** or **OK**.

When using a `.env` file for this fallback, use `OPENAI_API_KEY`; VibeCAD resolves that key normally and supplies it only to the bundled Codex process.

## Start a CAD Conversation

1. Create or open a CAD document and **save it**. VibeCAD keeps the assistant disabled for unsaved documents so the conversation, design record, references, and generated source have a durable project location.
2. Select the VibeCAD ribbon that matches the work you are doing, then choose
   **VibeScript** or **Native** in the Assistant header. Only the human can
   change either choice.
3. Open **View > Panels > VibeCAD Assistant** if the assistant is not visible.
4. Describe the intended result, including the dimensions, interfaces, material, manufacturing process, and constraints that matter.
5. Use **Attach Image** for a reference design, or paste an image into the message box with `Ctrl+V`. Use **Attach View** to include the current viewport in the next model request only; it is consumed after that delivery.
6. Choose **Build** to let Codex edit the document, or **Plan** to let it inspect and propose work with only read/view CAD tools. Then click **Send**. While work is running, the same input becomes **Steer**, so corrections stay in the same conversation. **Stop** ends the run after the current provider or CAD step returns.
7. Save the CAD document normally. Reopening it restores the associated VibeCAD conversations and project records.

Be explicit about functional intent, not only appearance. For an existing model, identify what should be preserved and what should change. For a new part, provide mating geometry and critical dimensions whenever they are known.

## Conversations

The conversation selector at the top of the assistant opens prior conversations for the current CAD document. The new-conversation button starts a clean thread without deleting earlier work. This makes it possible to separate a redesign, manufacturing discussion, or analysis task while retaining the project's history.

Saved conversations remain available to the human in this selector, but VibeCAD does not replay the project transcript or persisted tool traces into a model request. The model receives the current message exactly once. **Intent Memory** remains available as an explicit human project record, but it is not compiled after every turn or injected automatically.

Turn-start CAD context is deliberately small: the frozen authoring surface,
document identity, current edit object, exact selection, and one concise active
domain state. In VibeScript mode it also includes the editable source targets
owned by the active workbench. Each source target carries its stable ID,
revision, affected outputs, and exact read/edit calls. In Native mode the tool
declarations come only from the current VibeCAD ribbon and every mutation is
revalidated against the live document and frozen ribbon before execution.
Newly attached reference images and **Attach View** are delivered at the start
of each later turn until the human removes or replaces them.

## Choose Native or VibeScript authoring

**Native** is for direct, parametric editing with the same command families the
current VibeCAD ribbon exposes to a human. Tool surfaces are replaced only
between turns after the human changes ribbons. Calls use exact object and
subelement identities, structural revisions, transactions, concise receipts,
and domain-state refreshes. Native changes do not rewrite or regenerate a
VibeScript program.

**VibeScript** is for source-backed, fully automated designs. The active
workbench selects one dedicated VibeScript domain. Tools from different
workbenches are never combined, and accepted source remains the authority for
its published outputs. Direct Native mutation is therefore unavailable for a
VibeScript-owned document until the human explicitly takes manual control.

See [VibeCAD authoring modes](docs/vibecad-authoring-modes.md) for the complete
authority boundary and migration from the retired direct-tool surface.

## Workbench-shaped VibeScript execution

VibeScript keeps source, inputs, diagnostics, revisions, and accepted outputs
with the project. It runs in an isolated windowless worker and publishes only
validated results. The **Model Code Editor** lists programs for the active
workbench domain and opens with no program selected.

All 16 supported user-workbench VibeScript interfaces are production-ready:
Part Design, Sketcher, Draft, Surface, Assembly, Spreadsheet, Material, Mesh,
MeshPart, Points, Reverse Engineering, Inspection, Robot, FEM, CAM, and
TechDraw. Every domain exposes the same provider-facing
`vibescript.read_source`, `vibescript.read_api`, and `vibescript.edit_source`
tools for ordinary source changes, plus domain-qualified create, input-only,
contract-reconfiguration, and delete operations. Program source is addressed
by its stable per-program ID, and API inspection contains only the active
workbench's canonical runtime operations and typed outputs.

Geometry, solver, mesh, reconstruction, projection, and toolpath work runs in
the isolated worker. The live document receives only independently validated,
precomputed native state under stable program/output identities. This includes
native sketches and Draft proxies, Assembly links and joints, sheets and
material assignments, meshes and point clouds, reconstruction and inspection
records, Robot trajectories, FEM analyses/results, Path jobs/toolpaths, and
TechDraw pages/views/dimensions. Failed candidates remain inspectable without
replacing the accepted revision, and publication/deletion paths explicitly
restore accepted state when FreeCAD transaction rollback is incomplete.

Part, MeshPart, Points, CAM, and TechDraw deliberately collapse equivalent
variants behind selectors or one ordered pipeline instead of advertising
redundant operations. There are no forwarding wrappers for removed Part
operations. Startup, test, unknown, or future unimplemented workbenches resolve
to an exact unavailable surface; VibeCAD never substitutes another
workbench's tools.

## Local Models

For Ollama or another local OpenAI-compatible server, select **OpenAI API key (Codex)** and configure its endpoint. A common Ollama setup is:

```text
OpenAI base URL: http://localhost:11434/v1
Model: select a model returned by Fetch models
API key: any non-empty value accepted by the local server
Reasoning effort: none
```

The local server must already be running and expose an OpenAI-compatible API. Some local models reject reasoning parameters even when the server supports the endpoint; use `none` for those models.

## Troubleshooting

- **`not_configured`:** VibeCAD could not find the selected provider's environment variable, a valid key in the selected `.env` file, or a keyring entry.
- **No ChatGPT subscription is signed in:** open Preferences, select **ChatGPT subscription**, and complete browser or device-code sign-in.
- **No Grok / X account is signed in:** open Preferences, select **Grok (X / xAI)**, and complete **Sign in with X / Grok** or **Use device code**.
- **No CAD authoring tools are shown:** select a supported modeling workbench.
- **`configured_unverified`:** a key was found but has not been checked against the configured endpoint. Click **Validate**.
- **`invalid`:** the endpoint rejected the key. Confirm the selected provider, base URL, credential precedence, and account access.
- **`offline`:** the key could not be verified because the configured endpoint could not be reached.
- **No models are listed:** validate authentication first, then click **Fetch models**.
- **The model does not support thinking:** set **Reasoning effort** to `none`.
- **The assistant input is disabled:** save the active CAD document.
- **The assistant panel was closed:** reopen it from **View > Panels > VibeCAD Assistant**.

## Project Status

VibeCAD is under active development. The current focus is reliable, readable AI-assisted part design with explicit human control over the document, workbench, and design direction.

A local desktop agent (for example Grok Bot on Windows) can open documents,
run Python or VibeScript, show Preferences, and read auth status without
clicking menus. That loopback CLI / HTTP channel is documented in
[docs/vibecad-agent-control.md](docs/vibecad-agent-control.md). It does not
disable the in-app Assistant and it is not MCP.

Release packaging details are documented in [docs/vibecad-release-packaging.md](docs/vibecad-release-packaging.md).

The single-workbench Part and Part Design model, compatibility boundary, and
Body/tree behavior are documented in
[docs/part-design-consolidation.md](docs/part-design-consolidation.md).

The removed BIM and architectural surface, existing-document behavior, and
rollback path are documented in
[docs/bim-architecture-removal.md](docs/bim-architecture-removal.md).
